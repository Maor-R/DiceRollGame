# Dice Game

The game has 2 players, playing in rounds.
In each turn, a player rolls 2 dice as many times as he
wishes.
Each result will get added to his round’s score.
But if the player rolls a double six all his round’s score
gets lost.
After that, it's the next player’s turn.
A player can choose to ‘Hold’, which means that his
round’s score gets added to his global score.
After that, it's the next player's turn.
The first player to reach 100 points wins.
Add an input field where players can set the winning
score to change the predefined score of 100.
Players can create a new game whenever they want to.


##  Game instructions:
    In your turn - roll the dice (at least once) and accumulate the result in "current".
    You can roll again or click "Hold" to save the points from "Current" and end the turn.
    Note! if you get 6-6 you will lose all points from "Current" and the turn will go to your opponent.
    If you managed to reach exactly the target score - you win! If you passed it - you lose.
